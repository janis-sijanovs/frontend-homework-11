# Frontend Homework 11

I have completed my eleventh homework. 

I was very busy with different family stuff. My cousin got sick and I had to support her. 
My family visited Latvia from the UK and I had to spend time with them, and a few more side things.

I did the whole thing in one night and I was very sleepy. I didn't add all the styles, 
will do that before courses if I will have time.

I didn't do the extra task, and in the last task, I didn't make the cards into separate components.
The reason for that was that I didn't know how to pass setState functions to children, as they just didn't work when I tried.

Maybe they work as I expect, but I'm just too sleepy to understand what's wrong. We'll probably talk about it during lessons.
